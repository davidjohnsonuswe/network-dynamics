Network Dynamics - LTH course

This course will focus on common principles at the heart of the functioning of these networks and will show how the same notions related to connectivity, resilience and fragility, centrality and influence arise in several different domains. It will both introduce mathematical tools from **graph theory**, **random graphs**, **dynamical systems**, **optimization** and **game theory**, and cover a wide variety of applications including: opinion dynamics and learning in social networks; economic and financial networks; communication networks and the Internet; consensus and gossiping; spread and control of epidemics; dynamics and control of transportation and power networks.
